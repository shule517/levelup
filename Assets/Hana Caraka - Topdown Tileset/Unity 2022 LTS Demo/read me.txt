1. Unity has added the 2D Tilemap Extras by default. If not, install it via Package Manager.

2. Import Hana Caraka - Topdown Tileset.unitypackage

3. Create a new tilemap [2D Object -> Tilemap -> Rectangular]

4. Sometimes, you have to adjust the properties of Tilemap Renderer [for more info, pls read the documentation]

5. Open Tile Palette [Window -> 2D -> Tile Palette]

6. Select a tile, use a brush, and draw the map as you want to make it.

7. Only your imagination can set a limit!
