Heyo! 
Thank you for purchasing Tiny Wonder Farm Animals! :D

Here's a few guidelines for animating the characters included in the pack:
- All animals are 26x26px by default, except for chickens and baby chickens (they are both 16x16)
- It's better to either duplicate every frame or set it to 200 miliseconds for better walking animations (as shown in the showcase).

Hope you enjoy the pack and look forward for more updates!
